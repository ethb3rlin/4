From the early hacklabs, cross-sound performances,\n            Bring-Your-Own-Beamer initiatives, and crypto raves, the sense of a\n            joint collaboration has been at the core, inviting artists of many\n            disciplines and genres to create, exhibit and perform together,\n            creating novel social sculptural movements.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            It is in this ethos Department of Decentralization, in collaboration\n            with Refraction, presents 'co-create'. The exhibition asks questions\n            in and around identity, open source technology, and participatory\n            frameworks as they relate to contemporary on-chain discourse. The\n            work is presented on-chain and IRL, creating a new mode of action\n            and communication, bridging the exhibition space in Berlin and on\n            the blockchain, furthering the notion of presentation as\n            participation.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The IRL exhibition is inspired by the Bring-Your-Own-Beamer (BYOB)\n            initiative and asks presenting artists to consider and bring the\n            device on which they believe the work is best suited for.\n          </p>\n          <p>The BYOB concept was initiated by Rafaël Rozendaal.</p>\n          <h3 className=\"text-xl mt-6\">Talks</h3>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              12.00: Panel - <strong>Decentralized Art Organisation</strong>\n              <br />\n              With Vincent Trasov and Benny Giang; Moderated by Stina\n              Gustafsson.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              13.30: Panel - <strong>Art after NFTs</strong>\n              <br />\n              With Joan Heemskerk and Billy Rennekamp; moderated by María Paula\n              Fernández.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>\n            <h3 className=\"text-xl mt-6\">Biographies</h3>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Benny Giang</strong> is a founding team member of\n            CryptoKitties, the first NFT project to launch on Ethereum in 2017.\n            Since the formation of Dapper Labs he has taken on many different\n            roles from building the earliest NFT community in Asia to launching\n            several core projects such as Cheeze Wizards, Dapper Wallet, and NBA\n            Top Shot.
