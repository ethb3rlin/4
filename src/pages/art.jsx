        <em>An exhibition by Department of Decentralization and Refraction</em>

<p>
Public entrance and talks: Saturday, May 25th, 2024, from 11:00 to 17:00
</p>
<p>
In the history of media, sound, and related image-based practices, hardly any
city in the world has been as impactful in the concept of collaborative
performance and presentation as a genre and medium as Berlin. From the early
hacklabs, cross-sound performances, Bring-Your-Own-Beamer initiatives, and
crypto raves, the sense of a joint collaboration has been at the core, inviting
artists of many disciplines and genres to create, exhibit and perform together,
creating novel social sculptural movements.
</p>
<p>
It is in this ethos Department of Decentralization, in collaboration
with Refraction, presents 'co-create'. The exhibition asks questions in and
around identity, open source technology, and participatory frameworks as they
relate to contemporary on-chain discourse. The work is presented on-chain and
IRL, creating a new mode of action and communication, bridging the exhibition
space in Berlin and on the blockchain, furthering the notion of presentation as
participation.
</p>
<p>
The IRL exhibition is inspired by the Bring-Your-Own-Beamer (BYOB) initiative
and asks presenting artists to consider and bring the device on which they
believe the work is best suited for.
</p>
<p>
The BYOB concept was initiated by Rafaël Rozendaal.
